# DayPack - Hybrid Gradio Applications

DayPack allows Machine Learning Engineers who are already using Gradio to develop web applications to further leverage their experience and develop Hybrid Mobile Applications.  The goal of DayPack is to allow rapid 
prototyping so that OnDevice Machine Learning models can be tested and demostrated OnDevice, anywhere people go.

## How does it work?

```
import gradio as gr
import daypack 

dp = daypack(dp)
dp.pack()
dp.start()
```

The goal of DayPack is to allow rapid development of OnDevice Machine Learning models without Machine Learning engineers to have to learn C++, and for Machine Learning Engineers to be able to leverage
existing Gradio applications.

## Why DayPack?

Because the name backpack was already taken by other Python packages, and to keep with the outdoor theme of BaseWeight.

## Who is BaseWeight

BaseWeight is a small one person company started by @infil00p.  If you are interested in contacting BaseWeight regarding consulting, funding, please visit [[baseweight.ai]].
